# THEATRE MANAGEMENT

## A platform to manage theatres

### A Business owner has two theaters A and B with differnt capacity say 50 and 25 respectively at different locations.

Each theatre will host 3 shows daily. The show timings may vary form one theatre to another. The owner can decide to run same movie for all shows or with different movies.(System should be scalable to adopt multiple theatres and multiple shows).

Develop a console application which can help the business owner to manage his ticket vending process.

The system should be capable of doing the following:

1. Ability to issue and maintain tickets(for simplicity dont track about dates. assume all is for currrent day). The ticket prices can vary based on the selected type(I II or III class).

     Each ticket having a ticket number, seat number(not mandatory), 
name of the theatre, name of the movie and show, Ticket type and price.

2. Ability to list all the movies running in a particluar theatre.

3. Ability to list all movies.

4. Ability to list all Theatres with shows, given a movie name.

5. Ability to generate report(csv or excel) about the Revenue generated 
per show.
